# Flutter Community
**A central place for all community made Flutter packages.**

---

The Flutter Community is a GitHub organization used to manage community made Flutter packages.

Our goal is to ensure packages made by the Flutter community are kept alive and maintained in one place.

## Medium Articles
To go along with the packages, we have started a Medium publication as a central location for community content to be published - especially if it relates to the packages here.

# Submitting your packages
If you'd like to submit your package to the Flutter Community GitHub organization, please see the [Flutter Community Transfer Guide](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/transfer-guide).

## Getting in contact
For any questions regarding the Flutter Community, please [open an issue on the /community repository](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/community/issues/new/choose).

### Note to packages owners
Flutter Community aims to bring the best community-made packages forward. Because of this, not all proposed packages will be accepted.
